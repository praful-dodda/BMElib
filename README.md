# BMElib
BMElib is a powerful MATLAB numerical toolbox of Modern Spatiotemporal Geostatistics implementing the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) theory. It can be used for any of the following:
1. both spatial and space/time Geostatistics, dealing with
2. both continuous and categorical variables, implementing
3. the best unbiased non linear estimator (BME), which
4. rigorously processes hard and soft data, but also leads to
5. the (simple, ordinary, universal) kriging methods as linear limiting cases.

## Space/Time Geostatistics:
Unlike other Geostatistical package, BMElib has been implemented from the start for space/time Geostatistics. Hence BMElib implements the concepts of space/time metrics, space/time neighborhood search, space/time covariance analysis, and space/time estimation.  As a result BMElib provides better Geostatistical functions for space/time analysis than classical Geostatistics software (where time is included as merely another spatial dimension), while providing excellent functions in the purely spatial case.

## Non-Linear and Non Gaussian Geostatistics:
BMElib implements the powerful BME method of Modern Spatiotemporal Geostatistics. BME is a rigorous mathematical framework that allows processing a wide variety of knowledge bases, and leads to the best unbiased non linear estimator.  Hard data, soft data, non-Gaussian distributions, etc are automatically integrated in BMElib.

## Classical kriging :
When restricting the estimation to linear estimation of continuous variables, BME becomes the best unbiased linear estimators of classical Geostatistics.  Hence simple kriging, ordinary kriging, universal kriging, etc. are all part of the BMElib toolbox.
